- **CSS Reset** - resets all the built-in browser styles.
    - It imposes a homogeneous visual starting point.
    - It _unstyles_ everything and sets the stage for consistent styling.

- **CSS Normalize** - makes built-in browser styles consistent across browsers.
    - It also makes some elements look as expected.
    - It preserves useful defaults unlike a reset.

>CSS resets aim to remove all built-in browser styling. Standard elements like h1-6, p, strong, em, et cetera end up looking exactly alike, having no decoration at all. You're then supposed to add all decoration yourself. [^1]

> Normalize CSS aims to make built-in browser styling consistent across browsers. Elements like h1-6 will appear bold, larger et cetera consistently across browsers. You're then supposed to add only the difference in decoration your design needs. [^1]
