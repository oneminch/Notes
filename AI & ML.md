## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Primarily used to enhance language models' ability to access and utilize external knowledge.
- Combines information retrieval with text generation.
- Retrieves relevant information from a large corpus of documents or a knowledge base, which it then uses to augment the input to a language model.
- Ideal for question-answering systems, chatbots, and other applications where up-to-date or specific factual information is crucial.
- **Data Flow**: 
    - Query â†’ Retrieval System â†’ Retrieved Documents â†’ Language Model â†’ Generated Response

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

> [!quote] An open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.

- Designed to standardize how context is structured, shared, and utilized across different AI systems or components.
- Focuses on managing and transmitting contextual information.
- Useful in complex AI systems where multiple components need to share and understand context.
- **Data Flow**:
    - Context Provider â†’ Context Object â†’ AI Model/Service â†’ Updated Context
