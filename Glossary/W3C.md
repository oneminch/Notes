- The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international body that maintains Web-related rules and frameworks.
- It consists of over 350 member-organizations that jointly develop Web standards, run outreach programs, and maintain an open forum for talking about the Web. 
- The W3C coordinates companies in the industry to make sure they implement the same W3C standards.
- Each standard passes through four stages of maturity: 
    - **Working Draft (WD)**,
    - **Candidate Recommendation (CR)**,
    - **Proposed Recommendation (PR)**, and 
    - **W3C Recommendation (REC)**.
