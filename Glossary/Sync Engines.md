- In local-first software, sync engines enable data synchronization between a local client and a centralized server.
    - They allow apps to store data locally, enabling offline functionality. 
        - The app interacts directly with this local store, which is updated in real-time as users make changes.
    - Synchronization occurs in the background, allowing users to interact with apps offline while ensuring that data remains consistent across all devices and users when connectivity is available.
    - Developers specify what data should be synchronized, and the engine handles the details of how to reconcile changes across the network.
