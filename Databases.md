## Introduction

- Databases 
    - are structured digital information stores
    - build indices to efficiently query data
    - define relationships between datasets
- Every database has a way of structuring / organizing and interacting with this stored information: Database Management Systems (DBMS)
    - Fundamental ways of interacting with databases:
        - **C**reate
        - **R**ead
        - **U**pdate
        - **D**elete
        - Commonly known as CRUD
- DBMS's are mainly of two types:
    - **Relational**
        - organize data in tabular form with columns (categories / attributes) and rows (entries)
        - uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. 
        - often, data is organized into tables.
        - highly structured
        - strict data types
        - great for complex datasets
        - SQL is used to interact with them
        - a schema needs to be defined before putting anything into a database
          - ![[Database Schema]]
        - well known DBMS for these include MySQL & PostgreSQL.
    - **Non-relational** - which is also known as NoSQL; SQL is not used to interact with them.
        - generally more flexible and less strict
        - creating a schema isn't necessary
        - ideal for decentralised / distribured networks of data
        - e.g. graph, key-value, document
        - well known DBMS for these include MongoDB.

## Relational Databases

- **Primary Key**
    - A field which uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.
    - Must contain unique, non-NULL values
    - A table can only have one composed on single or multiple fields (*composite key*).
    - Generally created while the database and table are created, but can also be created after a table is created.
- **Foreign Key**
    - aka *referencing key*.
    - Used to link two tables together.
    - A column or combination of columns whose values match a primary key in a different table.
