- A programming language is considered low-level if it provides little or no abstraction from a machine's internal architecture. Code is very similar to writing actual machine instructions.
- Such languages are said to be "close to the hardware" due to that fact, and they can be processed (e.g. using an 'assembler') to run directly on the machine's processor. 

- Examples of low-level languages are Assembly and machine code.
