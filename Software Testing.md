### BDD

## Type of Testing

### Unit Testing

- Test specific low level units of functionality - typically functions.
- More unit tests are written compared to other types.
### Integration Testing

- Ensure the individual pieces of the application work well together.
- More integration tests are written compared to E2E tests.
### End to End (E2E) Testing

- Ensure application works well from the user's perspective.
- Less E2E tests are written compared to other types.
## Tools

- 3 classes of testing tools
    - Testing environment / test runners
        - collect test & run test code
    - Test frameworks
        - define / organize individual tests
    - Assertion libraries
        - create testable claims

- Common testing tools fall into at least 2 of the above classes.
