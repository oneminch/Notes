alias: Bundlers

- Bundling is the process of resolving an application's dependency graph and merging the different modules into bundles to reduce the number of files, and as a result the number of requests for the files.
- Web bundlers are tools used in web development that process the source files of an application into static assets utilized by browsers.
- They perform several key functions, such as 
    - [[Transpilers|transpilation]],
    - module concatenation, 
    - minification, 
    - resource management, and 
    - dependency resolution. 
- They also help manage other assets like stylesheets, images, and fonts, and track the dependencies between modules, enabling inclusion of only those parts of the code actually used in the project.
- Some popular web bundlers include Webpack, Vite, Parcel, Rollup, and Esbuild.
