- `@` - find symbol in current file
    - `@:` - group symbols
- `#` - find symbol across all files
- `%` - quick text search
- `Ctrl + Click` - go to definition
- `Ctrl + Alt + <- / ->` (custom) - select words by camel case
- `Shift + Alt + <- / ->` - expand/shrink selection scope by scope
    - e.g. In JS, running the command on an object property eventually expands the selection to the entire object and more.
    - Can also be used to select camel case symbols.
