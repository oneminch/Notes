- Dependency injection (DI) is a software design pattern used to enhance modularity, flexibility, and testability by decoupling the creation and use of dependencies.
- It involves providing an object or function with its required dependencies from the outside rather than having it create or resolve them internally.

- Examples: [[Vue]]'s `provide` & `inject`, [[React]]'s Context API
