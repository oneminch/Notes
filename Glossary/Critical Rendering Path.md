![Rendering Process](rendering.png)

- CRP refers to the sequence of steps browsers take to convert HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen.
- It involves several main steps:
    1. **Constructing the DOM**
        - The browser downloads and parses the [[HTML]] document to create the [[DOM]]. 
    2. **Building the CSSOM**
        - The browser processes [[CSS]] files to construct the [[CSSOM]].
    3. **Executing JavaScript**
        - Any [[JavaScript]] that may alter the DOM or CSSOM is applied.
    4. **Creating the Render Tree**
        - The DOM and CSSOM are combined to form the Render Tree, which is a representation of the visible elements on the page.
    5. **Layout**
        - The browser calculates the dimensions and positions of each element through a layout process.
    6. **Painting**
        - The browser paints the pixels onto the screen, completing the process.

## Optimization Strategies

To optimize the critical rendering path:

- Minimize Critical Resources
    - Reduce the number and size of resources required for initial page render.
- Reduce Render-Blocking Resources
    - Identify and minimize resources that block rendering, such as large CSS files or synchronous JavaScript that must be executed before the page can be displayed.
- Prioritize Content Loading
    - Ensure critical content is loaded first to improve perceived performance.
- Optimize CSS and JavaScript
    - Use techniques such as minification, asynchronous loading, and critical CSS inlining to ensure that essential styles and scripts are prioritized during loading.
- Optimize Images
    - Compress and properly size images to reduce their size and load times.
- Leverage Browser Caching
    - Implement effective caching strategies to store resources locally, reducing the need for repeated downloads on subsequent visits.
- Utilize CDNs
