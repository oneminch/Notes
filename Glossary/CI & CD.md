- CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.
- It is a software development practice that aims to streamline and accelerate the [[SDLC|Software Development Lifecycle]].
- It automates the entire software development process from code commit all the way thru deployment.

- Each commit triggers an automated workflow on a CI server.
- Continuous Integration (CI) involves automatically integrating code changes into a shared repo frequently, triggering automated testing to ensure the reliability of merged code changes.
- Continuous Delivery (CD) involves automating the release of validated code to a repo following automated builds and unit testing. 
    - Continuous Deployment is an extension of Continuous Delivery where changes are automatically released to production.
- The CI/CD workflow focuses on automation, tight version control, integrated feedback loops, security practices, and rapid iterative cycles to enhance software quality and speed up development processes.

- A typical CI/CD workflow:
    - The developer commits code changes to source control
    - The CI server detects changes and triggers the build
    - After code is compiled, different tests are run, and results are reported to the developer.
    - If tests are successful, artifacts are deployed to a staging environment where further testing may be done before release.
    - The CD system deploys approved changes to production
