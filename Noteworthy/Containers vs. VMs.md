| Feature               | Virtual Machines (VMs)                         | Containers                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Isolation**         | Full isolation; each VM has its own OS         | Process-level isolation; shares the host OS kernel              |
| **Resource Overhead** | Higher overhead due to separate OS for each VM | Lower overhead; lightweight, sharing the host OS                |
| **Startup Time**      | Slower startup; requires booting an entire OS  | Faster startup; can launch in seconds                           |
| **Portability**       | Portable but dependent on underlying hardware  | Highly portable; can run on any system with a container engine  |
| **Scalability**       | Less scalable due to resource demands          | Highly scalable; ideal for microservices architectures          |
| **Security**          | Stronger security                              | Weaker isolation; potential risks if the host OS is compromised |
