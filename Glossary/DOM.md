- The Document Object Model (DOM) of a page has a tree-like structure, where each element, attribute, and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. 
- The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.
