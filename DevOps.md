## Intro

- automated and repeatable
- a culture of strong collab b/n Dev & Ops
- a set of practices aimed at improving time-to-market
- should work in harmony with Agile practices

## 4 Key Principles**

- ==Automation of the [[SDLC|Software Development Lifecycle]]==: This includes automating testing, builds, releases, and the provisioning of development environments to increase efficiency and reduce errors.
- ==Collaboration and communication==: DevOps encourages cross-functional teams to work together closely, share responsibilities, and communicate frequently to reduce inefficiencies and improve the quality of services provided to customers.
- ==Incremental development and rapid delivery==: DevOps focuses on incremental development and rapid delivery of software, allowing teams to respond quickly to customer needs and build competitive advantage.
- ==Monitoring and feedback loops==: DevOps practices include monitoring and logging to ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes, allowing teams to reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining control and preserving compliance.

## Notes

- Some tasks in DevOps practices are shifted from IT to developers.
- DevOps can create new requirements, such as tooling support.
- The removal of oversight from deployments can create risk for organizations.
- Enabling DevOps practices often requires organizational change.
- Automation is not necessarily required to implement DevOps practices.
- Resource cost is important to DevOps practices

## Collaboration

- the most important aspect of DevOps practices
- shared responsibility b/n devs and ops personnel for incident handling
- consistent practices for both devs and ops personnel

## Practices

- During release, organizations care about:
    - collab with customers and stakeholders
    - packaging assets and service components
    - tracking deployment packages
    - can include automation to provide consistent feedback and deployments

## Why?

- Reduce errors
- Catch bugs before deployment
- Reproduceable deployment
- Faster code delivery
- Reduce money, time, customer costs that come with potential release failures
- Easier scaling due to automation
- Frequent releases
- Limited capacity of Ops staff
    - reduce the need for dedicated operations personnel
    - automating many of the tasks formerly done by operations
    - having developers assume a portion of the remainder
- Coordination between devs and ops personnel

---

- During a release process, organizations care about:
    - collaboration with customers and stakeholders,
    - packaging assets and service components,
    - tracking deployment packages,
    - Can include automation or IAC to provide consistent feedback and deployments
- Automation is key but not necessary. Tools and scripts also can enforce organization-wide policies.
    - Integration
    - Deployment
    - Provisioning
    - Configuration
- Automation will reduce the incidence of errors and will shorten the time to deployment.
- Purpose of automation tooling in DevOps: provide consistent feedback and deployments
- Source Code Management - Git
    - Branching / Merging
    - Commit early and often
- CI - process of automating code integration.
    - Merge, Build, Test
    - Connect to SCM repo, Pull, Build, Test, Approve merges, Notify of breakages
- CD
    - **Infra Provisioning** - Get servers spun up
    - **Infra Configuration** - Install requirements
    - If part of CI, utilizes CI tools. Otherwise, connects to artifact management tool which takes an existing artifact and deploys it.
- Infra as Cattle
    - Easily
        - Changed
        - Replaced
        - Duplicated
        - Automated
- Provisioning & Configuration
    - VMs
        - Emulate the entire system
        - Specific OS
        - Needs configuration
    - Containers
        - Cross-platform
        - Contains all needed components
        - Once configured, always configured
    - Config / Infra as Code:
        - Version controlled
        - Looks like code
- **Canaries** - deploy to small number of servers
- **Rollbacks** - how to decommission an update
- **Microservices** - small stateless portions of a system connected through a larger system

## Potential Barriers

- Tool support
- Personnel issues
- Organizational culture
- Organization / department type
    - Regulated Industry / Domain
    - Mature / Slow Moving Domains

## Concerns

- Security
    - Data loss
    - DevSecOps
- Getting Started
    - Infra to support tooling
    - Getting customers on board
    - **Goal** - Reduce the time between software development and deployment while maintaining quality.
    - **Lifecycle**
        - ![software-devops-lifecycle.png](/assets/images/devops.software-devops-lifecycle.png)
    - Notes on Agile
        - Roles in a team executing a DevOps process consist of service
          owner, reliability engineer, gatekeeper, and DevOps engineer.

## The Cloud as a Platform

- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    - Development Tools
    - Web Servers
    - Database
    - Execution Runtime
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - CRM
    - Virtual Desktops
    - Web-based email services
- Infrastructure as a Service
    - VMs
        - an emulation of a physical machine
        - are set in an environment, a set computing resources
        - **Elasticity** is the ability of resources to grow or shrink to meet demands
        - **Baking an image** refers to the amount of software pre-installed on a VM
        - Common causes for VM failure:
            - **stateless components** - recovery by creating another instance of the same VM image and ensuring that messages are correctly routed to it.
            - **client states**
            - **application states**
    - Storage
    - Load Balancers
    - Networks
- Environment: set of computing resources
- Dependability problems come from: possibility that an instance can fail, inter-team coordination, and correctness of environment
- **NoSQL (Not Only SQL) DBs**
    - not as mature as relational systems
    - appropriate data models must be decided upon by application programmer
    - applications may use multiple DB systems for d/t needs
- **DevOps Consequences of the Unique Cloud Features**
    - **Environments** - ensuring the environments meet the needs of the development and operations tasks
    - **Easy VM Creation** - controlling the proliferation of VMs
    - **Databases** - managing different database management systems

## Operations

- Things to consider when designing a service
    - What are the SLAs for the service?
    - What automation will be involved as a portion of the service?
    - Implications of the service?
    - What are the information security implications of the service?
    - What are the personnel requirements of the service?
    - What are the business continuity implications of the service?
- Responsibilities of Dev + Ops Personnel (Overlap)
    - Provisioning of hardware
    - Provisioning of software for organizational support
    - IT Functions: Service Desk Support, Technology Experts
    - Capacity Planning
    - Monitoring logs and other data in regards to app performance
    - Business continuity - Cost / Benefit analysis of:
        - data loss in the event of a failure
        - time it takes to recover from a failure
    - Information Security

## Overall Architecture

- While some DevOps practices are independent of architecture, in order to get the full benefit of others, architectural refactoring may be necessary.
- An organization can introduce continuous deployment without major architectural modifications.
- Microservices
    - composes several smaller services into a single system with complete functionality
    - coordination between dev teams responsible for interacting services is important.
    - multi-version deployments
    - reduces the necessity for inter-team coordination by making global architectural choices.
    - deployment rollbacks
    - **Dependability** - stateless services
        - **Problems**
            - small amount of inter-team coordination
            - environment correctness
            - possibility of a service instance failing
    - **Modifiability** - small services
- Continuous Deployment
    - Continual Service Improvement is the process and goal of improving the alignment of IT services with business needs and the quality of deployed software
    - Requires some architectural support.

## Automation

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- Allows developers and operations teams to manage and provision infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.

- IaC uses declarative definitions to specify the desired state of infrastructure. 
    - Instead of writing step-by-step instructions, definitions describe what you want the end result to look like.
    - e.g. Using Terraform to create an AWS EC2 instance with specific attributes, without detailing the exact steps to create it:

```
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
    ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    tags = {
        Name = "WebServer"
    }
}
```

- Files are treated like application code and stored in version control systems like Git.
    - This enables tracking of changes, collaboration, and rollbacks.
- IaC tools ensure idempotency.
    - The same configuration can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
    - e.g. Using Ansible to Install Apache if it's not present, but don't make changes if already installed:

```yml
- name: Ensure Apache is Installed
    yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
```

- IaC enables automation of infrastructure provisioning and management, reducing manual errors and increasing efficiency.
    - e.g. Using AWS CloudFormation to automatically create an S3 bucket when applied:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
    MyS3Bucket:
        Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
        Properties:
            BucketName: my-unique-bucket-name

```

- IaC promotes creating reusable modules for common infrastructure patterns.
    - e.g. Using Terraform modules to reuse a pre-defined VPC module, which allows for consistent VPC creation across projects:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
    source = "./modules/vpc"
    cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

- IaC allows treating infrastructure like software, applying software development practices to infrastructure management. 
    - e.g. Using TypeScript with AWS CDK to define a VPC:

```ts
import * as ec2 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import { Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

class MyInfrastructureStack extends Stack {
    constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
        super(scope, id, props);

        const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'MyVPC', {
            maxAzs: 2
        });
    }
}
```
