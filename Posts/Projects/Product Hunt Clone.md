## What

Discover & Share is a full-stack clone of Product Hunt built with Node + PostgreSQL + Bootstrap.

## Why

I made this as a project for a web development class in college. I had creative freedom in what to build, and I decided to create my own version of one of my favorite products at the time - Product Hunt.

## How

Each project had to be built using Node.js, Bootstrap, and MySQL, and be deployed to Google Cloud Platform. I made the views (pages) using Bootstrap and the Handlebars templating language, and created several different endpoints using Node.js for each view. Data was submitted to and retrieved from a MySQL database hosted on Google Cloud Platform along with the entire application.

Over time, I migrated the backend to use a PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku along with the application.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: `Handlebars`, `Bootstrap`
- **Backend**: `Node.js`, `PostgreSQL`
- **Deployment**: `AWS Elastic Beanstalk`
