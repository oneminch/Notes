- In a type safe programming language, the compiler validates data types while compiling, and ensures the right type is assigned to a variable.
- A type error is thrown when a program tries to perform an undefined operation on a value. e.g. Treating an integer as a string.

```cpp
// Compile time error - invalid conversion
int age = "thirty";
```
