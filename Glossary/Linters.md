- Linters are tools that run a set of diagnostic checks on your source code, often called rules. 
- Each rule is typically tailored to one specific check, such as unused variables or preferring a cleaner syntax pattern over an equivalent but messier one.
- ESLint is a popular linter used in the [[JavaScript]] ecosystem.
