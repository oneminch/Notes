- A programming language is considered high-level if it provides strong abstraction from the details and internal architecture of a computer.
- Unlike [[low-level language]]s, it may:
    - use natural language elements,
    - be easier to use, or
    - automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable.
- The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is.
