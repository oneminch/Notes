## Standardization

- Web standards are the technologies used to build on the web. They exist as long technical documents called ==specifications==, and are created by standards bodies (which are institutions that invite groups of people from different tech companies to come together and agree on how the technologies should work in the best way). The [[W3C]] is the best known body. Others include:
    - **WHATWG**: maintain the living standards of [[HTML]].
    - **ECMA**: publish standard for ECMAScript, which [[JavaScript]] is based on.
    - **Khronos**: publish technologies for 3D graphics, such as WebGL.
- Due to the open nature of web standards, the web remains a freely-available public resource.
- Specifications detail exactly how a technology should work, and are intended for use by software engineers to implement the technologies (usually in web browsers).
    - e.g. HTML Living Standard describes how HTML (elements, and their APIs as well as surrounding technologies) should be implemented.

- In the context of JavaScript debugging, a **_breakpoint_** is a point in code where the debugger will automatically pause the execution.
    - The `debugger;` command also pauses code execution when the developer tools are open.
    - An error also paused execution.
