alias: Immediately Invoked Function Expression
---

- An IIFE or an Immediately Invoked Function Expression is a function that is invoked as soon as it is defined.
- Since `var` doesn't have block-level visibility, IIFEs were primarily a way to emulate a block-scope. This allowed to write code without polluting the global namespace.
