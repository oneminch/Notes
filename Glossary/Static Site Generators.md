- Static site generators take raw data and a set of templates to generate a fully static HTML website.
- [[HTML]] pages are pre-built using the data and templates instead of generated on demand. This contribute greatly to performance.
- SSGs are a big part of the Jamstack approach to web development. Pre-built pages are stored on a CDN, and are served when requested.
- It's also referred to as ==pre-rendering==.
