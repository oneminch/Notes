- A protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- Allows for persistent, bidirectional, real-time data exchange between a client (typically a web browser) and a server without the need for constant polling.
- Reduces overhead compared to traditional HTTP requests.
- Ideal for applications requiring instant data updates.
- Can be secured using the WSS (WebSocket Secure) protocol, similar to HTTPS.
- **Benefits**
    - Reduced latency due to fewer handshakes.
    - Lower overhead as headers are sent only once during the initial handshake.
    - Real-time data transfer without polling.
-  **How It Works**
    - WebSocket connections start with an HTTP handshake, where the client requests to upgrade the connection to WebSocket (using the `Upgrade` header).
        - If the server supports WebSockets, it responds with an HTTP 101 status code, indicating that the protocol is being switched.
        - Once the server agrees, the connection is upgraded, and both parties can send data simultaneously. 
        - Data is exchanged in the form of "frames," which can carry text or binary data and can be sent continuously.
    - After the connection is established, both the client and server can send messages to each other at any time.
    - The connection remains open until either the client or server decides to close it.
        - Allows for long-lived connections, ideal for applications requiring constant updates.
        - Either party can initiate a connection closure. The connection is gracefully closed after both sides have exchanged close frames.

```javascript
// Create a new WebSocket connection
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socketserver');

// Connection opened
socket.addEventListener('open', (event) => {
    socket.send('Hello Server!');
});

// Listen for messages
socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    console.log('Message from server:', event.data);
});
```

> [!note]
> Connections are stateful, which can present challenges when scaling applications.

## Example

```js
// server.js
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

const clients = new Set();

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
    // Client Connected
    clients.add(ws);

    ws.on('message', (message) => {
        console.log('Received:', message);
        // Broadcast the message to all connected clients
        clients.forEach((client) => {
            if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
                client.send(message);
            }
        });
    });

    // Client Disconnected
    ws.on('close', () => {
        clients.delete(ws);
    });
});
```

```jsx
// App.js
function App() {
    const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
    const [inputMessage, setInputMessage] = useState('');
    const socketRef = useRef(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        socketRef.current = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3001');

        socketRef.current.onopen = () => {
            console.log('WebSocket Connection Established');
        };

        socketRef.current.onmessage = (event) => {
            const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
            setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, message]);
        };

        socketRef.current.onclose = () => {
            console.log('WebSocket Connection Closed');
        };

        return () => {
            socketRef.current.close();
        };
    }, []);

    const sendMessage = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        if (inputMessage && socketRef.current.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
            const message = {
                text: inputMessage,
                timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
            };
            socketRef.current.send(JSON.stringify(message));
            setInputMessage('');
        }
    };

    return (<>
        <div>
            {messages.map((msg, index) => (
                <div key={index} className="message">
                    <span className="timestamp">
                        {new Date(msg.timestamp).toLocaleTimeString()}
                    </span>
                    <span className="text">{msg.text}</span>
                </div>
            ))}
        </div>
        <form onSubmit={sendMessage}>
            <input
                type="text"
                value={inputMessage}
                onChange={(e) => setInputMessage(e.target.value)}
                placeholder="Type a message..."
            />
            <button type="submit">Send</button>
        </form>
    </>);
}
```

## ## Best Practices

- Always use the encrypted `wss://` (WebSocket Secure) protocol instead of `ws://` to prevent man-in-middle attacks and ensure data confidentiality.
- Implement strict input validation on both client and server sides to prevent injection attacks, including XSS and SQL injection.
- Implement robust authentication mechanisms, such as token-based authentication, and ensure proper authorization checks for WebSocket connections.
- Validate the `Origin` header to prevent unauthorized cross-origin connections.
- Implement rate limiting to protect against DoS attacks and excessive resource consumption.
