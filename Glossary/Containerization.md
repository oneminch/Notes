- A lightweight alternative to traditional virtualization.
- It allows to package applications and their dependencies into containers, which can run consistently across different computing environments.
- Containers share the host OS kernel and isolate the application processes.
- **Benefits**:
    - Portability
    - Scalability
    - Fault Tolerance
    - Agility
- **Use Cases**:
    - Microservices Architecture
        - Containerization aligns well with microservices, where applications are broken down into smaller, independently deployable services. 
        - Each microservice can run in its own container, simplifying deployment and management.
    - Cloud Migration    
        - Legacy applications can be encapsulated in containers, facilitating smoother transitions to cloud environments without extensive rewrites.
    - DevOps Practices
        - Containers enable consistent environments for development, testing, and production, which enhances collaboration between development and operations teams.
