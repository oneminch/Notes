## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- CORS is a crucial security mechanism that allows web servers to specify which origins can access their resources. 
- Implemented by browsers to relax the Same-Origin Policy in a controlled manner. 
    - It's not a server-side restriction, but a client-side one enforced by browsers.
- Implemented through HTTP headers. 
    - When a browser makes a cross-origin request, it expects specific CORS headers in the response (e.g., Access-Control-Allow-Origin). 
    - If these headers are missing or incorrect, the browser blocks the request, even if the request succeeds at the network level and the server successfully processed it.
- When a web app from one origin tries to access resources from a different origin, the browser sends a preflight request to check if the server allows such requests.
- Best Practices:
    - Always specify allowed origins rather than using a wildcard (`*`) in production.
    - Store allowed origins in environment variables for easy configuration across different environments.
    - When using credentials, ensure cookies are secure and use `SameSite` attributes.
    - Only allow the necessary HTTP methods and headers.
    - Implement proper error handling for CORS-related issues on both client and server sides.
- Common CORS Headers:
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` - Specifies which origins can access the resource.
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` - Specifies the allowed HTTP methods.
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` - Indicates which headers can be used in the actual request.
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` - Indicates whether the response can be shared when the credentials flag is true.

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://example.com');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true);
  next();
});
```

```javascript
// Express setup using the `cors()` middleware
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(cors({
    origin: 'http://example.com'
}));

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is accessible from http://example.com' });
});
```

- **Same-Origin Policy**
    - Browsers enforce security policies based on the headers they receive from the server.
    - They restrict how a document or script from one origin can interact with resources from another origin, which prevents malicious sites from accessing sensitive data on other sites.
    - CORS allows servers to relax this restriction for specific requests.
    - When making requests from one server to another, the Same-Origin Policy and CORS don't apply. 
        - Servers can freely make requests to any other server without these restrictions.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

- Allows you to specify which sources of content browsers should allow to load. 
- Helps prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
- Implemented through [[HTTP]] headers.
- Typically handled at the server level, so there are challenges with SPAs. 
    - Libraries like [[React]] often use inline scripts for performance. 
        - Use [[Server-Side Rendering|SSR]] to inject [[nonce|nonces]] for inline scripts.
        - Use a build system that calculates hashes for inline scripts and styles.
    - Because of CSS-in-JS tools and external resources as well, CSP might need to be adjusted.
- Best practices:
    - Start with a strict policy and relax as needed.
    - Use `'strict-dynamic'` for script sources when possible.
    - Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` in production.

```js
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.setHeader(
        'Content-Security-Policy',
        "default-src 'self'; " +
        "script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com; " +
        "style-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com; " +
        "img-src 'self' data: https://images.example.com;"
    );
    next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(`
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>CSP Example</title>
                <script src="https://trusted-cdn.com/script.js"></script>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://trusted-cdn.com/styles.css">
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Hello, CSP!</h1>
                <img src="https://images.example.com/picture.jpg" alt="Example Image">
                <script>
                    console.log('This inline script is allowed by CSP');
                </script>
            </body>
        </html>
    `);
});
```

## HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)  

- A web security policy mechanism that helps protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.
- Tells web browsers to only interact with a website using secure [[HTTP#HTTPS|HTTPS]] connections, never [[HTTP]].
- Implemented through an HTTP response header.

```js
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    if (req.secure) {
        res.setHeader(
            'Strict-Transport-Security',
            'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload'
        );
    } else {
        return res.redirect(301, `https://${req.headers.host}${req.url}`);
    }
    next();
});

// Your routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, secure world!');
});

const credentials = {
    key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/your/private-key.pem', 'utf8'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/your/certificate.pem', 'utf8')
};

const httpsServer = https.createServer(credentials, app);

httpsServer.listen(443, () => {
    console.log('HTTPS Server running on port 443');
});

// Create HTTP server (for redirection)
const httpServer = http.createServer(app);
httpServer.listen(80, () => {
    console.log('HTTP Server running on port 80');
});
```

## Permissions-Policy

- Allows website administrators to control which browser features and APIs can be used by a page and its embedded content.
- Operates on the principle that embedded content should not automatically have access to powerful web features, while granting such access to top-level documents.

> [!example] 
> > Ensure only the main site and a trusted payment processor can access payment information:
> 
> ```
> Permissions-Policy: payment=(self "https://secure-payments.example.com")
> ```
> 
> > Disable geolocation for all third-party content (embedded ads or social media widgets can't access user location):
> 
> ```
> Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(self)
> ```

```js
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.setHeader(
        'Permissions-Policy',
        'camera=(self), payment=(self "https://secure-payments.com")'
    );
    next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello! Check response headers for Permissions Policy.');
});
```

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Occur when malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites. 
- Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- DOM-based XSS occurs when the client-side script writes user input to the DOM in an unsafe way. 
    - Particularly relevant in React applications with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` method.
- To prevent XSS:
    - Always validate and sanitize user input before storing or rendering it.
    - When rendering user-generated content, always encode it properly.
    - Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources of content that can be loaded and executed on your site.
    - Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies to prevent client-side access and ensure they're only sent over HTTPS.

> [!example]
> If someone submits this into a form (`<img src onerror="alert('HACKED!')" />`) and the input isn't encoded properly (`?query=<img+src+onerror%3D"alert%28%27Hacked!%27%29">`), navigating to the URL from somewhere else can execute the injected script.

### SQL Injection 

- Involves inserting malicious SQL code into application queries. 
- To mitigate:
    - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements
    - Validate and sanitize user inputs
    - Implement least privilege database access

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- Allows attackers to trick users into performing unwanted actions on a web application where they're authenticated.
- Primarily concerned with state-changing requests (like POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Bypasses the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) because SOP primarily restricts cross-origin reads, not cross-origin writes.
- Attack mechanism:
    - User logs into a legitimate website (e.g., a bank).
    - User's session is maintained through cookies.
    - Without logging out, the user visits a malicious website.
    - Malicious site tricks the user's browser into sending a request to the legitimate site.
    - The legitimate site processes the request, thinking it came from the authenticated user.
- Prevent by:
    - Using anti-CSRF tokens in forms.
        - Always use HTTPS to prevent token theft through man-in-the-middle attacks.
        - Regularly rotate CSRF tokens, especially after user authentication.
    - Set the `SameSite` attribute on cookies. 
        - `Strict` offers robust defense against CSRF.
    - Verifying origin and referrer headers for non-GET requests.
        - It's important to ensure that the application doesn't use GET requests for modifying resources.
    - Implement proper session management, including secure session IDs and timeouts.
    - Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information.

```js
const app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.json());

const generateCsrfToken = () => {
    return crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
};

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.cookies.csrfToken) {
        const token = generateCsrfToken();
        res.cookie('csrfToken', token, { httpOnly: true, secure: true });
    }
    next();
});

app.get('/getCSRFToken', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ CSRFToken: req.cookies.csrfToken });
});

const validateCsrfToken = (req, res, next) => {
    const tokenFromHeader = req.headers['x-csrf-token'];
    const tokenFromCookie = req.cookies.csrfToken;

    if (!tokenFromHeader || tokenFromHeader !== tokenFromCookie) {
        return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid CSRF token' });
    }
    next();
};

app.post('/api/data', validateCsrfToken, (req, res) => {
    res.send('Data received securely.');
});
```

```jsx
export const MyComponent = () => {
    const [csrfToken, setCsrfToken] = useState('');

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchCsrfToken = async () => {
            const response = await axios.get(
                '/getCSRFToken', 
                { withCredentials: true }
            );
            setCsrfToken(response.data.CSRFToken);
        };
        fetchCsrfToken();

        /* OR */

        const parts = `; ${document.cookie}`.split('; csrfToken=');
        
        if (parts.length === 2) {
            setCsrfToken(parts.pop().split(';').shift());
        }   
    }, []);

    const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();

        try {
            await axios.post('/api/data', 'Some Data', {
                headers: {
                    'X-CSRF-Token': csrfToken,
                },
                withCredentials: true,
            });
            console.log('Success!');
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error!', error);
        }
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value={csrfToken} />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
};
```

### Clickjacking

- An attacker tricks a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, potentially leading to unintended actions.
- Attack mechanism:
    - The attacker typically overlays a transparent `<iframe>` containing a target website over a decoy website. 
    - The user thinks they're interacting with the decoy site, but they're actually clicking on elements of the target site.
- Prevention
    - The primary defense against clickjacking is the `X-Frame-Options` HTTP header.
        - `DENY`: The page cannot be displayed in a frame.
        - `SAMEORIGIN`: The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself.
        - `ALLOW-FROM uri`: The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origin.
    - Use CSP header on your server.
    - Use HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that could inject iframes.
    - Be cautious when allowing your site to be framed by third-party sites.
    - Only embed when it's necessary.
    - Use [[HTTP|HTTPS]].
    - Always use the `sandbox` attribute to restrict an `iframe`'s capabilities.
