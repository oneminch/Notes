## Patterns

### Monolithic

- This pattern consists of a single, unified unit for the entire application.
- All components exist in a single codebase.
    - They are tightly integrated and deployed together.
- Examples:
    - A simple web application that serves HTML pages with a backend that handles user data, such as a blog or a CMS.
    - A mobile or desktop application that has a single executable, such as Microsoft Word.
- **Advantages**:
    - Simple and easy to develop for small to medium-sized applications.
    - Fast development cycles and quicker time-to-market for new features.
    - Simpler deployments with less risk of deployment errors.
    - Easier to understand how different parts of the application work together
    - Easier to debug and trace issues with tools.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Becomes more complex and harder to manage as the application grows.
    - Debugging and tracing issues can become difficult in large applications.
    - Limited flexibility in technology choices and scalability options.

### Multi-Tier

- This pattern divides the application into multiple layers or tiers.
- Each tier is responsible for a specific functionality or task.
    - Commonly used layers include presentation, application, and data layers.
- It's ideal for 
    - new applications that need to be built quickly, 
    - enterprise or business applications, 
    - teams with inexperienced developers, and 
    - applications requiring strict maintainability and testability standards.
- Examples:
    - A distributed system that has a separate presentation layer for the user interface, an application layer for the business logic, and a data layer for storing data, with each layer running on a separate server or cluster of servers.
- **Advantages**:
    - Allows for easier updating and enhancing of layers separately.
    - Improves maintainability and testability by isolating layers.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Can lead to a "big ball of mud" if not properly organized.
    - Layer isolation can make it hard to understand the architecture without understanding every module.
    - Monolithic deployment is often unavoidable, requiring complete redeployment for small changes.

### Microservices

- This pattern consists of multiple independent applications, each implementing specific business logic for a function area.
    - They are split based on business functionalities.
    - Each service has its own database and communicates with other services through APIs.
- Examples:
    - A complex web application that has multiple services, such as a shopping cart, payment processing, and inventory/user management
    - A cloud-native application that has multiple services, such as a social media platform with services for user profiles, news feeds, and messaging
- **Advantages**:
    - Faster deployment and testing of individual services
    - Supports multiple technology stacks for different services
    - Segregates subdomains by their characteristics for better availability and security
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Can be more complex to design and implement due to distributed operations and eventual consistency
    - Increased operational overhead due to managing multiple services and databases
    - Requires more planning and coordination to ensure smooth communication between services

### Serverless

- This pattern reduces the requirement for managing servers, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code while cloud providers manage the infrastructure.
- Applications are broken up into individual functions that can be invoked and scaled individually.
- It is ideal for applications with variable workloads and sporadic traffic patterns.
- Examples:
    - Trigger-based actions or running scheduled tasks
    - Building RESTful APIs for web and mobile applications
    - Automating [[CI & CD|CI/CD]] pipelines
    - Integrating with third-party services and APIs
- **Advantages**: 
    - Automation
    - Scalability
    - Productivity
    - Cost Efficiency - pay-per use model can result in cost savings
    - Operational Efficiency - simplified infrastructure management tasks
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Performance issues - delays in response time when unused for a certain period, aka "cold starts"
    - Vendor lock-in
    - Limited flexibility
    - Security - each function can serve as a potential attack surface
    - Monitoring and debugging challenges due to the application's distributed nature
    - Expensive for certain use cases, especially ones with high execution times or frequent invocations
    - Complexity in managing and coordinating multiple functions and services
