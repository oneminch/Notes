alias: Hot Module Replacement
---

- A feature of [[bundlers]] and build tools that allows developers to update modules (like JavaScript, CSS, or other assets) in an application without a full page reload.
- Unlike a full refresh, HMR tries to preserve the state of an application (like Vue component state or Pinia store).
- When change to a file is made, the build tool:
	1. Detects the change.
	2. Recompiles only the changed module.
	3. Swaps the old module with the new one in the running application.
- Tools like Vite support HMR.
