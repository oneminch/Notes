In this article, I'll write how I created a self-hosted image optimization service for a side project. The project will take advantage of serverless functions and the Vercel platform to create an image optimization service like Sirv or Cloudinary. The motivation for me to build this project was to have my own self-hosted solution to manage images I used on my side project [EncryptedList](https://encryptedlist.xyz).
