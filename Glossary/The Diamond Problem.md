- The diamond problem in [[Java]] refers to an ambiguity that can arise when a class inherits from two parent classes that have a common ancestor class. 
- It is called the "diamond problem" because of the diamond-like shape formed by the class inheritance hierarchy.
- In such a scenario, the compiler cannot determine which implementation of the method or field to inherit, leading to ambiguity.

```java
class A {
    void method() { /* ... */ }
}

class B extends A { /* ... */ }
class C extends A { /* ... */ }

class D extends B, C {
    // Ambiguity: 
    // Which method() implementation should D inherit?
    // From B (inherited from A) or from C (inherited from A)?
}
```

- To avoid the problem, Java does not allow a class to extend multiple classes directly. 
- Instead, Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
    - Interfaces can have default methods, and a class can implement multiple interfaces without causing the diamond problem.
- The problem highlights the complexities of multiple inheritance and the need for careful design considerations in [[Object-Oriented Programming|OOP]].
