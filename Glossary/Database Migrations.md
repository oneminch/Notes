- Database migrations are version control systems for a database schema. 
- They're structured scripts that define incremental changes to a database structure over time, allowing the database schema to evolve in a controlled, reproducible way.
- They allow you to automate the process of updating your database structure by generating and applying migration scripts based on differences between your code-defined schema and the current database state.
- Each migration typically contains two parts:
    - **Up migration**: Changes to apply (create table, add column, etc.)
    - **Down migration**: How to reverse those changes (rollback)
- Migrations are executed in sequence, and the system tracks which migrations have been applied to prevent duplicate execution.
- They solve the problem of keeping database schemas synchronized across different environments (development, staging, production) and team members. 
    - Instead of manually applying SQL changes, migrations provide a systematic way to track and apply schema modifications.
