## Introduction

- Databases 
    - are structured digital information stores
    - build indices to efficiently query data
    - define relationships between datasets
- Every database has a way of structuring / organizing and interacting with this stored information: Database Management Systems (DBMS)
    - Fundamental ways of interacting with databases:
        - **C**reate
        - **R**ead
        - **U**pdate
        - **D**elete
        - Commonly known as CRUD
- DBMS's are mainly of two types:
    - **Relational** - which organize data in tabular form with columns (categories / attributes) and rows (entries)
        - highly structured
        - strict data types
        - great for complex datasets
        - SQL is used to interact with them
        - a schema needs to be defined before putting anything into a database
          - ![[Database Schema]]
        - well known DBMS for these include MySQL & PostgreSQL.
    - **Non-relational** - which is also known as NoSQL; SQL is not used to interact with them.
        - generally more flexible and less strict
        - creating a schema isn't necessary
        - ideal for decentralised / distribured networks of data
        - e.g. graph, key-value, document
        - well known DBMS for these include MongoDB.
