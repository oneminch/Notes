- Web bundlers are tools used in web development that process the source files of an application into static assets utilized by browsers.
- They perform several key functions, such as 
    - transpilation, 
    - module concatenation, 
    - minification, 
    - resource management, and 
    - dependency resolution. 
- They also help manage other assets like stylesheets, images, and fonts, and track the dependencies between modules, enabling inclusion of only those parts of the code actually used in the project.
- Some popular web bundlers include Webpack, Vite, Parcel, Rollup, and Esbuild.
