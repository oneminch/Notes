- Coordinated Universal Time
- The primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.
- A precisely kept atomic time standard, which is the basis for civil time and time zones worldwide.
    - e.g. 2025-02-21T23:55:00Z (ISO 8601 format)
        - The "Z" at the end of the ISO 8601 format stands for "Zulu time," which is another name for UTC.

## UTC vs. GMT

- GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) is a time zone, while UTC is a time standard.
- GMT is based on the Earth's rotation, while UTC is based on atomic clocks.
- UTC is more precise than GMT due to its atomic clock basis.
- UTC uses leap seconds to stay synchronized with the Earth's rotation. GMT doesn't.
- In practice, GMT and UTC are often used interchangeably because they usually align exactly. However, they can differ by up to 0.9 seconds.
