## Methodologies

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- The goal of TDD is code quality.

- **Advantages**
    - Clarified thinking / code design
    - Better communication between developers
    - Better structure / organization of production code

- **Disadvantages**
    - Takes longer initially
    - Bad tests create a fall sense of security

![Red -> Green -> Refactor](assets/images/tdd.red-green-refactor.png)
- Good tests should be:
    - ==R==eadable
    - ==I==solated - test run independent of one another
    - ==T==horough - cover all edge cases
    - ==E==xplicit

### BDD

## Type of Testing

### Unit Testing

- Test specific low level units of functionality - typically functions.
- More unit tests are written compared to other types.
### Integration Testing

- Ensure the individual pieces of the application work well together.
- More integration tests are written compared to E2E tests.
### End to End (E2E) Testing

- Ensure application works well from the user's perspective.
- Less E2E tests are written compared to other types.
## Tools

- 3 classes of testing tools
    - Testing environment / test runners
        - collect test & run test code
    - Test frameworks
        - define / organize individual tests
    - Assertion libraries
        - create testable claims

- Common testing tools fall into at least 2 of the above classes.
