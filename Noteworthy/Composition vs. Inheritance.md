- ==Inheritance== involves designing objects around *what they are* 
    - Objects have 'is-a' relationship.

```js
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name
    }

    eat() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is eating.`)
    }
}

class Bird extends Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        super(name)
    }

    fly() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is flying.`)
    }
}

const robin = new Bird("Robin")
robin.eat()
robin.fly()
```

- ==Composition== involves designing objects around *what they do*.
    - Objects have 'is-a' relationship.

```js
const eater = (animal) => ({
    eat: () => console.log(`${animal.name} is eating.`)
})

const flyer = (animal) => ({
    fly: () => console.log(`${animal.name} is flying.`)
})

const eatingFlyer = (name) => {
    let animal = {
        name: name
    }

    return Object.assign(
        {},
        eater(animal),
        flyer(animal)
    )
}

const robin = eatingFlyer("Robin")
robin.eat()
robin.fly()
```
