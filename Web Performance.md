> Web performance refers to how quickly site content **loads** and **renders** in a web browser, and how well it responds to user interaction.

## Why

- Good web performance is important for accessibility, and correlates powerfully with the overall effectiveness of the website.
- Improving web performance by reducing download and render times of a site leads to better conversion rates and user retention.
- Building web apps with performance in mind is an integral part of the user experience.
## Optimization

- The major areas of performance optimization:
    - **Reducing overall load time**: correlates with latency, file size, number of files and other factors
        - Reducing file size and the number of HTTP requests, and utilizing preloading can be a good general strategy.
    - **Making sites usable as soon as possible**: involves prioritizing parts of the website so that users can interact with content quickly, and loading other assets in the background or when they are needed (lazy loading).
        - This aspect of performance is measured by the Time To Interactive (TII) metric.
    - **Smoothness & interactivity**: utilizing best practices to give smooth animations/transitions a smooth feel improves perceived performance.
    - **Perceived performance**: matters as much, or perhaps more than, any objective measurement.
        - Providing a quick response / feedback and regular status updates (e.g. via a loading animation) improves perceived performance.
        - Tips for improving perceived performance: 
            - Minimizing initial load
            - Reducing content reflows
            - Using progressive enhancement
            - Avoiding font file delays
        - Some metrics can be helpful indicators of perceived performance:
            - First paint
            - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
            - First Meaningful Paint (FMP)
            - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
            - Speed index
            - Time to interactive
    - **Performance measurements**: include both actual (objectively measured) and perceived (subjectively experienced) speeds.
        - Tools that can help measure and improve performance:
            - **PageSpeed Insights / WebPageTest** - websites for getting useful performance reports
            - **Network & Performance Monitor** (Firefox) - browser built-in tools 
            - **Performance API** - to build custom tools
## Multimedia

- For the average website, multimedia accounts for 75% of its bandwidth. 
- It's important to consider data usage, and device memory usage of users.
    - Downloaded images are stored in device memory.
### Images

- [[Lazy loading]] images can greatly improve performance.
- Other strategies for optimizing images:
    - **Using an optimal format** - 
    - **Compression**
    - **Serving optimal sizes**
        - Serving lower resolution images for smaller screens and vice versa.
- Images added using `<img>` have a higher loading priority than ones using CSS `background-image`. So, it's important to use `<img>` / `<picture>` for content images.
    - Loading priority can also be controlled using the experimental `fetchPriority` attribute.
        - An example use case can be a carousel where the first image has higher priority than subsequent ones.
- As part of a good UX design, it's important to consider reflow / layout shifts when loading multimedia.
    - Setting the `width` and `height` attributes on an image can reserve space in the layout to avoid shifts when the image finally loads.
    - Once the image has loaded, the image's intrinsic aspect ratio is used, instead of the aspect ratio from the attributes. Even if the attribute dimensions are not accurate, the image is displayed in its correct aspect ratio.
- For `background-image` images, it's important to add a `background-color` value so if there is any overlaid content, it's still readable before the image has loaded. 
### Video

- To better optimize video delivery:
    - Compress all videos.
    - Prioritize `<source>` order - from smallest to largest.
    - Ensure `loop`ing background videos have `autoplay` set.
        - Additionally, set `muted` for mobile and `playsinline` for Safari.
    - Remove audio for video that doesn't need audio (e.g. looping hero videos).
        - Audio consumes bandwidth. Remove it if it's not needed.
    - Control preloading using `preload`.
    - Consider streaming.
