## Cloud Computing Essentials

![[Cloud Computing]]


## Pricing

- AWS pricing fundamentals:
    - **Compute**
    - **Storage**
    - **Data transfer** - pay only for data transferred *out* of the cloud

## Shared Responsibility Model (SRM)

> [!quote]- Shared Responsibility Model
> Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.
> ![Shared Responsibility Model](shared-responsibility-model.jpg)
> **Source**: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) 

## Core Concepts

### Regions

- Cluster of data centers
- Most AWS services are region-scoped.

- **What determines where to launch a new service?**
    - ==Compliance== - Data never leaves a region w/o explicit permission
    - ==Customer Proximity== - Reduced latency
    - ==Service Availability== - Not all services are available in every region 
    - ==Pricing== - Varies from region to region

### Availability Zones (AZ)

- Within each region, there are several separate yet connected availability zones, usually anywhere from 3 to 6.
- Each AZ contains one or more data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity.
- AWS Region: Sydney (ap-southeast-2)
    - ap-southeast-2a, ap-southeast-2b, ap-southeast-2c

### Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

- Deliver content to end users with low latency. 
- 400+ in 90+ cities across 40+ countries.

## Services

- Some global services - IAM, Route 53, CloudFront, WAF
- Some regional services - EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Rekognition

### IAM

- Identity and Access Management
- Root account is created by default and associated with an organization.
- Users
    - People within an organization 
    - Can be grouped
    - Can belong to multiple groups
    - Don't necessarily have to be part of a group
- Groups
    - Only contain users, not other groups
- Roles
    - Identities that can be assumed by users, applications, or AWS services
    - Used to grant temporary access to AWS resources without sharing long-term credentials.
    - Can have multiple policies attached to it, combining the permissions from each policy.
        - When an entity (user, application, or service) assumes a role, it gains the permissions defined by the policies attached to that role.
- Policies
    - JSON documents that define permissions
    - Assigned to users (Inline) or groups 
    - Attached to roles to define what the role is allowed to do
    - **Policy Structure**
        - `Version` - Policy language version (2012-10-17)
        - `Id` - Optional Policy identifier
        - `Statement` - One or more (required)
            - `Sid` - Optional statement identifier
            - `Effect` - '`Allow`' or '`Deny`' access
            - `Principal` - account/user/role to which the policy is applied
            - `Action` - list of allowed or denied actions
            - `Resource` - list of resources the actions apply to
            - `Condition` - Optional conditions that determine when the policy is in effect

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:AttachVolume",
                "ec2:DetachVolume"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {"aws:ResourceTag/Department": "Development"}
            }
        }
        ...
    ]
}
```

> [!quote]- IAM Best Practices
> ![IAM Best Practices](iam-best-practices.png)
> - Credit: [Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/)

- **Password Policies**
    - Min length
    - Whether changing own password is allowed
    - Character types required, 
    - Expiration date
    - Prevent re-use of passwords (that were used within a certain date range)

- **MFA Options**
    - Virtual MFA devices - Single device / multi-token
        - e.g. Authy
    - U2F - Single key / multi-user (root or IAM)
        - e.g. YubiKey
    - Hardware
        - Key fob devices

- **Ways to Access AWS**
    - **AWS Management Console (Web UI)** - Password + MFA
    - **AWS CLI** - Secret Access Keys
        - Alternative to using the management console web UI.
    - **AWS SDK** - Secret Access Keys
        - Language and platform-specific libraries
        - Embedded within applications to manage AWS services programmatically

> [!note]
> Users manage their own access keys.

- **IAM Roles for Services**
    - Permissions assigned to AWS services, so they can perform actions on user's behalf.
    - Common roles include EC2 roles, Lambda Roles, etc

- **IAM Security Tools**
    - **IAM Credentials Report** - Account-level
        - Lists all users and their credential status under an account
    - **IAM Access Advisor** - User-level
        - Lists service permissions granted to a user along with its last access time
        - Can be used to revise policies using the Least Priviledge approach

### Compute

#### EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- IaaS
    - Rent VMs (via EC2)
    - Data storage on virtual drives (via EBS)
    - Load distribution across machines (via ELB)
    - Service auto-scaling (via ASG)
- Can be configured to meet demands
    - OS
    - CPU & RAM
    - Storage Type and Amount
        - Network-attached (EBS / EFS)
        - Hardware (EC2 instance store)
    - Network Card
    - Firewall Rules
    - Bootstrap Script
        - Automated launch commands that run once (with root user permissions) on machine boot
            - e.g. Install updates/software, download files
- Instance types can be created that are optimized for different use cases 
    - Storage optimized
    - Network optimized
    - Memory optimized
    - Compute optimized
- General purpose instances provide a balance of the different resources. These are great for various types of workloads such as setting up web servers.
- An example name for an instance type can be `t2.micro`:
    - ==t== - instance class
    - ==2== - generation
    - ==micro== - size within instance class

- **Security Groups**
    - Fundamental to AWS network security.
    - 'Firewall' around EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.
        - Access to ports
        - Authorized IP ranges (IPv4 & IPv6)
    - Only contain allow rules
    - By default, 
        - all inbound traffic is blocked.
        - all outbound traffic is authorized (stateful).
    - Rules can be referenced by IP or by security group
    - Can be attached to multiple instances
    - Scoped to a region/VPC combination
    - If application
        - times out, the issue is because of a security group
        - refuses connection, the issue is because of an application or launch error

> [!important]
> It is considered best practice to maintain one separate security group for SSH access.
> 
> Never enter access keys into EC2 instance.

> [!question]
> Which option is suitable for a certain type of workload?

- **SRM for EC2**
    - The customer is responsible for 
        - OS patches and updates
        - Software and utilities installed on an instance
        - Security group rules, IAM roles and IAM user access

##### AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

- a customization of an instance: software, config, OS, monitoring
    - basically like a scaffold or template for an instance setup
- built for specific region but can be copied across.
- instances can be launched from:
    - A public AMI - AWS-provided
    - Custom AMI - custom made and maintained
    - Marketplace AMI - made/sold by a third-party

- **EC2 Image Builder**
    - used to automate the creation, maintenance, validation and testing of VMs or container images (AMIs)
    - can be run on a schedule

#### Container Services

##### ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- Launch Docker containers on AWS
- Self-provisioned and self-managed infra (EC2 instances)
- AWS takes care of starting and stopping containers.
- ALBs can be integrated
##### Fargate

- Serverless ECS
- AWS runs containers based on resource requirements (CPU/RAM)
##### ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

- Private Docker registry on AWS where images are stored to be run by ECS or Fargate

#### Serverless Services

- No server provisioning / management
- e.g. S3, DynamoDB, Fargate
##### Lambda

- Event-driven virtual functions that are time and runtime limited
    - short executions
- On demand and auto-scaling
- Multi-language support
- Pricing calculated per request and compute time
- **Lambda Container Images** - Lambda-specific way to run containers
    - Lambda is not ideal for generic Docker images

##### Amazon API Gateway

- Expose and proxy request to Lambda functions
- Fully managed, serverless and scalable
- support RESTful and WebSocket APIs
- support security, auth, API keys, API throttling, monitoring

##### AWS Batch

- Batches are 
    - jobs with a start and an end.
    - defined as Docket images and run on ECS
- AWS Batch provides managed batch processing at scale
- dynamically launch EC2/Spot instances with right amount of compute
- user schedules jobs, AWS takes care of the rest.
- no time limit
- support any runtime

##### LightSail

- Virtual servers, storage, databases and networking.
- low and predictable pricing
- simpler alternative to other services
    - for people with little cloud experience
- highly available, auto-scaling
- limited AWS integrations

### Storage

#### S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- allows storing objects (files) in buckets (directories)
- buckets 
    - must have a globally unique name (lowercase and numbers)
    - are ==created at the region level==
    - no concept of directories within buckets
- objects have a key which represents the full path of the object.
    - keys - made up of prefix and object name
        - e.g. `s3://my-bucket/dir1/.../image.png`
- max file size allowed - 5TB
- when uploading if file size exceeds 5GB, must use 'multipart upload'
- Use cases
    - Backup and storage
    - disaster recovery
    - archive
    - hybrid cloud storage
    - application hosting
    - media hosting
    - data lakes and big data analytics
    - software update delivery
    - static websites (if public access is enabled)

- **Security**
    - **User-based** - IAM policies
    - **Resource-based**
        - **Bucket Policies**
            - most common
            - bucket-wide rules
            - used to grant 
                - cross-account access
                - public access to bucket
                - force object encryption on upload
            - JSON-based
                - resources - buckets/objects
                - effect - allow/deny
                - actions - APIs allowed or denied
                - principal - account/user to which the policy applies
                - Public access is blocked by default. For public access policies to work, it needs to enabled.
        - **Object Access Control List**
            - fine-grain control
            - can be disabled
        - **Bucket Access Control List** (less common)
            - can be disabled
    - **Encryption**
        - Server-Side Encryption - default
        - Client-Side Encryption

> [!note]
> An IAM principal can access an S3 object if:
> - user IAM policy ALLOWs it or resource policy ALLOWs it, AND
> - there is no explicit DENY

- **Versioning**
    - considered best practice
        - unintended deletion protection
        - easy rollbacks
    - can be enabled at the bucket level
    - same key overwrite changes the version number

> [!note]
> Files unversioned prior to enabling versioning will have a version ID of null.
> 
> Suspending versioning doesn't delete previous versions.
> 
> Deleting a file version automatically rollback it back to its previous version.

- **Replication**
    - can be of two types:
        - Cross-Region Replication
            - useful for compliance, low latency access and cross-account replications
        - Same Region Replication
            - useful for log aggregation
    - versioning must be enabled in source and destination buckets
    - buckets can be in different accounts
    - copying is asynchronous
    - proper IAM permissions must be given to S3
    - version IDs are also replicated
    - replication rules apply to objects created/uploaded after the creation of the rule unless one-time replication is enabled during rule creation

##### Storage Classes

- **Durability**
    - Extremely high durability of objects across multiple AZs
    - Same across all storage classes
- **Availability**
    - depends on storage class
        - e.g. Standard is not available 53 minutes/year

###### Amazon S3 Standard

- Frequently accessed data
- low latency, high throughput
- able to sustain two concurrent facility failures

    - used for backups and disaster recovery
- **One Zone IA**
    - 99.5% availability
    - high durability in a single AZ
        - data is lost if AZ is destroyed
    - used for secondary backups and recreatable data

###### S3 Glacier

- **Deep Archive**
    - long term
    - minimum storage duration of 180 days
    - Standard - 12 hrs
    - Bulk - 48 hrs

###### S3 Intelligent Tiering

- small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
- automatically move objects automatically b/n Access Tiers based on usage
- no retrieval charges

- **Frequent Access Tier** - (auto) default
- **Infrequent Access Tier** - (auto) objects not accessed for more than 30 days
- **Archive Instant Access Tier** - (auto) objects not accessed for more than 90 days
- **Archive Access Tier** - (optional) objects not accessed between 90 and 700+ days
- **Deep Archive Access Tier** - (optional) objects not accessed between 180 and 700+ days

> [!note]
> Lifecycle rules define accounts to move S3 objects between different storage classes.

##### SRM for S3

- **AWS is responsible for:**
    - sustaining concurrent loss of data in 2 facilities
    - compliance validation
- **Customer is responsible for:**
    - versioning, policies, replication setup
    - logging and monitoring
    - data encryption at rest/in transit

#### EBS (Elastic Block Store)

- block-level storage
- network drive that can be (optionally) attached to instances while running
- because they are network-attached
    - there might be latency
    - they can be attached/detached quickly
- data is persisted even after termination
    - can be configured using the "delete on termination" attribute
        - can be managed via the console or CLI
        - enabled by default for root EBS
        - disabled by default for other EBS
- can only be mounted to one instance at a time
- are bound to a specific AZ
    - can be moved (backed up and restored) to a different AZ 
- provisioned capacity
    - billing occurs for all capacity purchased

- **Snapshots**
    - backups made at a certain point in time, so they can be restored
    - recommended (but not required) to detach volumes before a snapshot
    - can be copied across AZs or regions
    
    - **Snapshot Archive** - cheap, but take longer to restore (24-72 hrs)
    - **Recycle Bin** - rules can be set up to retain/retrieve deleted snapshots. 
        - retention period can be specified (1d - 1yr).

#### EC2 Instance Store

- block-level storage
- high-perf hardware disk
- better I/O perf and throughput
- ephemeral
    - if hardware fails, there is risk of data loss
    - use cases - buffer, cache, temporary data
    - backing up is the responsibility of the customer

#### EFS (Elastic File System)

- cross-AZ, cross-VPC and cross-Region, managed network FS (NFS)
- can be mounted (shared) across hundreds of instances
- works with a Linux instance
- highly available, scalable and expensive
- no capacity planning - pay per usage

- **EFS-IA (EFS Infrequent Access)**
    - lower cost than standard EFS (92% lower)
    - cost optimized for infrequently accessed files
    - files can be moved to EFS-IA based on last access time
    - enabled with a Lifecycle Policy
        - e.g. move files not accessed before 90 days to EFS-IA

### Networking

#### Load Balancing

- Vertical Scalability (VS)
    - Scale up/down
    - increase size of instances
        - e.g. t2.micro -> t2.large
    - common for non-distributed systems such as databases
    - there is a limit to VS because of hardware capabilities
- Horizontal Scalability (HS) - Elasticity
    - Scale in/out
    - ASG, ELB
    - increase # of instances / systems
    - common on web applications
    - implies distributed systems
- High Availability (HA)
    - usually goes hand in hand with HS
    - running instances/systems in multiple AZs (at least 2) 
    - ASGs + ELBs in multi-AZ mode
    - Goal - survive a disaster such as loss of a data center

> [!note]
> Scalability is linked to but different from high availability (HA)

- Elasticity
    - cloud-native term referring to load-based auto-scaling
    - cost-optimized - pay per usage
    - matches demand
- Load Balancers (LB)
    - are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple instances
    - spread across multiple instances
    - expose a single point of access to apps
    - handle failure of instances
    - do regular health checks on instances
    - provide HTTPS
    - HA across AZs

- **ELB (Elastic Load Balancers)**
    - fully-managed LBs
- **ALB (Application Load Balancers)**
    - HTTP/HTTPS/gRPC protocols
    - Layer 7
    - Static DNS / URL
    - HTTP routing
- **NLB (Network Load Balancers)**
    - ultra high-perf (millions of requests per second)
    - Static IP
    - TCP/UDP protocols
    - Layer 4
- **GWLB (Gateway Load Balancers)**
    - Layer 3
    - GENEVE protocol
    - route traffic to firewalls managed on instances
    - for intrusion detection / deep packet inspection
- **Classic Load Balancers**
    - Retired 2023
    - Layer 4 & 7

#### ASG (Auto-Scaling Groups)

- allow scaling as load changes
    - scale in (remove instances) for low loads
    - scale out (add instances) for high loads
- ensure there is a min and max # of machines running
- auto-register/de-register instances to an LB
- replace unhealthy instances
- cost optimized

- **Scaling Strategies**
    - Manual
    - Dynamic
        - *Simple*
            - e.g. CPU usage < 30%, remove instances
        - *Target Tracking*
            - e.g. Avg. ASG CPU should stay at 40%
        - *Scheduled*
            - anticipated based on known usage patterns
