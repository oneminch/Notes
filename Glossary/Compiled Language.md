- Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute.
    - As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than [[interpreted language]]s. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.
- Compiled languages need a "build" step - they need to be manually compiled first.
    - You need to "rebuild" the program every time you need to make a change.
- Examples of pure compiled languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go.
