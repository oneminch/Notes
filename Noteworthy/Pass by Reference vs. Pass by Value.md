- The difference between passing by reference and passing by value lies in how the parameter is handled when passed to a function. 

- **Passing by Value**:
    - A copy of the actual parameter's value is created and passed to the calling function.
    - The function operates on this copy, not the original variable. Therefore, any changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable in the calling code.
- **Passing by Reference**:
    - The memory address of the actual parameter is passed to the function, allowing the function to access and modify the original variable directly.
    - If the parameter is modified inside the function, the changes are reflected in the original variable outside the function.
