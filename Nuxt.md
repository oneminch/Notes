## Commands

- `nuxi add` - adds a template of a file to a Nuxt project.

> [!example]
> ```bash
> # Generates `components/TheHeader.vue`

- `nuxi build` - creates a `.output` directory with the application, server and dependencies ready for production.
- `nuxi dev` - start a dev server with HMR at `http://localhost:3000`.
- `nuxi generate` - pre-renders every route of an application and stores the result in plain [HTML](HTML.md) so that it can be deployed on any static hosting service. 
    - It triggers the `nuxi build` command with `prerender` set to `true`
