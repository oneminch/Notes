## Architectures

### RESTful

- Representational State Transfer
    - Defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. 
    - Use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources identified by URIs.
- Allow accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.
    - Resource-based and stateless
        - Resources are defined using nouns. e.g., `/users`
- Ideal for web servers
- Benefits
    - Standardization
    - Statelessness
    - Flexibility (of resource or methods)
    - Interoperability

```
GET /api/users/123
```

- A simple REST API in [[Express]]:

```js
let users = [
    { id: 1, name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" },
    { id: 2, name: "Jane Smith", email: "jane@example.com" },
];

// GET /users - Retrieve all users
app.get("/users", (req, res) => {
    res.json(users);
});

// GET /users/:id - Retrieve a specific user
app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
    const user = users.find((u) => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
    
    if (!user) {
        return res.status(404).json({ error: "User not found" });
    }
    
    res.json(user);
});

// POST /users - Create a new user
app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
    const { name, email } = req.body;
    
    const newUser = { id: users.length + 1, name, email };
    users.push(newUser);
    
    res.status(201).json(newUser);
});

// PUT /users/:id - Update an existing user
app.put("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
    const { name, email } = req.body;
    
    const user = users.find((u) => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
    
    if (!user) {
        return res.status(404).json({ error: "User not found" });
    }
    
    user.name = name;
    user.email = email;
    
    res.json(user);
});

// DELETE /users/:id - Delete a user
app.delete("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
    const index = users.findIndex((u) => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
    
    if (index === -1) {
        return res.status(404).json({ error: "User not found" });
    }
    
    const deletedUser = users.splice(index, 1)[0];
    
    res.json(deletedUser);
});
```

### [[GraphQL]]

- A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with existing data.
- Protocol-agnostic
- Reduce network load by giving clients the power to ask for exactly what they need.

```
query {
    user(id: "123") {
        name
        email
    }
}
```

### SOAP

- Simple Object Access Protocol
- A protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.
- Use XML-based messages that follow a specific format.
- Ideal for enterprise-level applications that require high security and transactional reliability. 
    - Suitable for private APIs, especially in industries like finance and healthcare, where data integrity and security are important.
- An example request:

```xml
<soap:Envelope 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
    <soap:Body>
        <GetUserInfo xmlns="http://example.com/">
            <userId>123</userId>
        </GetUserInfo>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### gRPC

- Google Remote Procedure Call
- High performance
- Ideal for microservices
- Use Protocol Buffers

### [[WebSockets]]

- Bi-directional communication
- Ideal for low-latency data exchange such as real-time / live collaboration applications

### Webhooks

- Asynchronous communication
- Ideal for event-driven applications

## REST API Design

### Principles

- **Uniform Interface**
    - Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and consistent naming conventions for resources. 
    - Each resource should have a unique URI.
- **Client-Server Separation**
    - The client and server should be independent of each other, allowing them to evolve separately.
- **Statelessness**
    - Each request from the client to the server must contain all information needed to understand and complete the request. 
    - The server should not store any client context between requests.
- **Cacheability**
    - Responses should be cacheable when possible to improve performance.
- **Layered System**
    - The API may be composed of multiple layers, but this should be transparent to the client.
- **Resource-Based**
    - Organize APIs around resources, using nouns instead of verbs in endpoint paths.
- **Representations**
    - Resources should have uniform representations in server responses. 
    - Use standard formats like JSON.
- **Self-Descriptive Messages**
    - Each message should include enough information to describe how to process it.
- **Versioning**
    - Implement versioning to manage changes and updates without breaking existing clients.
- **Security**
    - Use SSL/TLS for encryption and implement proper authentication and authorization.
- **Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination**
    - Allow clients to request specific data subsets for better performance and usability.
- **Clear Documentation**
    - Provide comprehensive documentation explaining how to use the API.
- **Consistent Error Handling**
    - Use standard HTTP status codes and provide clear error messages.

### Parameters

- Path parameters - `/products/{id}`
    - Part of a URL path.
    - Typically used to point to a specific resource within a collection, such as a product identified by its `id`.
- Query parameters - `/products?type=laptop`
    - More common.
    - Appear at the end of the request URL after a question mark (`?`).
        - Contain different `key=value` pairs separated by `&`.
    - Can be required and optional.
- Header parameters - `X-MyCustomHeader: Value`
- Cookie parameters - `Cookie: key1=value1; key2=value2`
    - Passed in the Cookie header
    - e.g. `Cookie: debug=0; csrftoken=ERT9dlhP3O1NWwPLC`

## Specifications

### OpenAPI Spec

- The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a community-driven open specification that provides a standard, language-agnostic interface to describe RESTful APIs. 
- It describes RESTful APIs in a machine-readable format, enabling a variety of tooling and automation around API development and consumption.
- It is maintained and developed by the OpenAPI Initiative under the Linux Foundation.
- Formerly known as the Swagger Specification.
- Key points:
    - It defines a standard way to describe HTTP APIs, allowing both humans and machines to understand the capabilities of a service without additional documentation or inspection of network traffic.
    - It supports use cases such as interactive documentation, code generation for clients and servers, and automation of test cases facilitating both design-first and code-first API development approaches.
    - It is represented in either YAML or JSON formats and can be produced statically or generated dynamically from an application.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
    title: Sample API
    version: 1.0.0
paths:
    /users:
        get:
            summary: List users
            responses:
                '200':
                    description: Successful response
```

#### Swagger

- The tooling ecosystem that helps implement and work with the OpenAPI Specification.
- Includes various tools that help in designing, building, documenting, and consuming REST APIs.
    - Swagger UI - automatically generates interactive API docs
    - Swagger Editor - allows designing and modeling APIs according to the OpenAPI Specification.
    - Swagger Codegen - helps build stable, reusable code for APIs in various languages.

### JSON:API

- A specification for building APIs in JSON, focusing on how to structure API responses and requests.
- Defines a specific JSON structure for API responses and requests.
- Primarily concerned with the format of data exchanged between clients and servers, not the overall API description.

### AsyncAPI Spec

- A standard for describing event-driven APIs, similar to how OpenAPI is used for RESTful APIs.

## Best Practices

### Common Mistakes (API Design)

- Inconsistency or lack of a unified design across platforms.
- Incorrect Use of HTTP Methods.
- Lack of Documentation
    - Insufficient details about endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and error handling.
- Oversharing Data
    - Can expose too much data, and create security vulnerabilities & performance issues.
- Ignoring Scalability
    - Not planning for growth can lead to performance degradation as usage increases.
- Bloated Responses
    - Excessive data in responses increases latency and bandwidth usage.
- Poor Error Handling
    - Vague or confusing error messages complicate troubleshooting for developers.
- Neglecting Versioning
    - Lack of versioning can disrupt existing users with breaking changes.
- Complexity in Design
