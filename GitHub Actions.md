- GitHub Actions is a platform for automating workflows in the [[SDLC|Software Development Lifecycle]] on GitHub.
- Workflows consist of events, jobs, and steps, and are triggered by events, such as creating a pull request, or pushing to a branch.
    - Events are triggers that kick off a workflow,.
    - Jobs are a set of steps that execute on the same runner.
    - Steps are individual actions.
- GitHub Actions supports multiple operating systems and languages within the same workflow.
- It offers native CI/CD functionality, but can also automate any webhook.
- It integrates seamlessly with GitHub's existing features.
- Benefits of GitHub Actions include: 
    - Automating workflows across issues, pull requests, and more.
    - Adding preferred tools and services to a project.
    - Multi-container testing and "matrix builds."
    - Live logs for watching workflows run in real time.

            - name: Install dependencies
              run: npm ci

            - name: Build project

                  path: ./dist

            - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
              uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
