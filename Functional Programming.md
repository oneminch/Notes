- Functional Programming is a subset of the [[Declarative Programming]] paradigm, where programs are written by composing pure functions.
- Functions are treated as [[First-Class Functions|first-class citizens]], and they avoid using and mutating shared state.
- Key principles of FP
    - **Data Immutability** - Functions don't mutate data.
    - **[[Pure Functions|Purity]]** - Functions don't change global state.
    - **Data Transformation** - Functions produce *transformed* copies of data.
    - **[[Higher-Order Functions]]**
    - **[[Currying]]**
    - **[[Recursion]]**
    - **Composition** - Functional programs are *composed* of small, pure functions that perform a specific task.
